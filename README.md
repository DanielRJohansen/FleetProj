# FleetProj

## Install
Simply run the main CMakeLists, which will compile 2 programs, Agent and Server

## Run
First start an instance of Server.
Then start as many instances of Agents as youâ€™d like, and as rapidly you'd like. 

To shut it all down, simply terminate the server.
The Agents will shutdown after 10 seconds if they can't contact the server
